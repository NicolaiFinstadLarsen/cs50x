SELECT AVG(energy), AVG(danceability), AVG(valence) FROM songs;
Avg energy = 0.65906
Avg danceability = 0.71646
Avg Valence = 0.48443

SELECT AVG((energy + danceability + valence) / 3.0) AS avg FROM songs;
Tot Avg = 0.6199876

If this was a listeners top 100 songs. I would characterize them as a dancer with lots of enery.





There are some issues I can propose with the solution.
1. There is not use of the tempo colum. This would be usefull if the dancing song would actually be used for dancing.
2. People are not monotone. They listen to different music all the time. There should be some accounting for time played. Maybe a weighted avg would work better.
3. There are noe genres of music in the table. This would also be beneficial to the analysis.
