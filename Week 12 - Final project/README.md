## The beginning ##

I wanted to build something that appeard on the screen and no only in the terminal. The hunt to find an ide was on. 
I had other ideas that had to do with finances and crawling websites, but as I read the project description, I understood that these projects would not be in the spirit of using what we had learned in cs50x.
I then found the sentece in on the project page 
>Strive to create something that outlives this course.<
So that was what I wanted to do. I thought about what I acctually would want to use in the future, some project that, even though, I have delivered it in this course, I could keep working on for a long time.
