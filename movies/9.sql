--write a SQL query to list the names of all people who starred in a movie released in 2004, ordered by birth year.
--Your query should output a table with a single column for the name of each person.
--People with the same birth year may be listed in any order.
--No need to worry about people who have no birth year listed, so long as those who do have a birth year are listed in order.
--If a person appeared in more than one movie in 2004, they should only appear in your results once.
SELECT DISTINCT name FROM people JOIN stars ON people.id = stars.person_id JOIN movies ON stars.movie_id = movies.id WHERE year = 2004 ORDER BY birth;

--Executing 9.sql results in a table with 1 column and 19,325 rows.
--SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT name) FROM people JOIN stars ON people.id = stars.person_id JOIN movies ON stars.movie_id = movies.id WHERE year = 2004 ORDER BY birth;
--Litt for f√• rader. Hvorfor?
