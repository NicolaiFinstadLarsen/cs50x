As well as a brief (one-sentence) description of how you chose to use JavaScript and Bootstrap.
I used javascript to activate my dropdown button. I also converted my pythonscript of the 3x+1 conjecture into javascript.
I used bootstrap for containers everywhere for allignment, I also used bootstrap for the carousell and the grid for tictactoe text.
